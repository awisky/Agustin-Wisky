From the moment I wrote my first line of code at the age of 12, I was hooked on the transformative power of technology. With a career spanning over a decade, I've developed a robust expertise in Odoo development and DevOps engineering. I've led projects that refined deployment processes and enhanced system reliability across multiple continents, from Latin America to Europe and the Middle East.

Specialized in analyzing organizational needs and architecting tailored ERP solutions with a strong focus on Odoo customization and system integration. With extensive DevOps and Full Stack development expertise, I provide strategic planning and implementation of scalable technology ecosystems. Partner with me to transform your business processes and infrastructure.

## What Drives Me:
- **Innovation in Technology:** Specializing in scalable solutions from the ground up, using tools like Odoo, Django, FastAPI, Jenkins-X, Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS.  
- **Problem Solving:** Whether it's optimizing ERP systems or building sophisticated infrastructure environments, I thrive on tackling complex challenges.

## Outside the Code:
I find balance in nature, where trail running, climbing, and exploring the rugged landscapes of Patagonia keep me grounded. A firm believer in minimalism, I seek simplicity and focus both in my personal life and professional projects.
